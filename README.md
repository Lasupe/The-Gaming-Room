The project's client, The Gaming Room, wanted to make their game "Draw It or Lose It," which was first created as an Android app, available online and on other platforms. Teams compete in a sketching and guessing exercise in this game, which was modeled by the Win, Lose, or Draw television program from the 1980s. In order to handle a large number of concurrent users and preserve features like real-time sketching and scoring, the client requested that the updated version be available on a variety of devices, including desktops and mobile platforms.

I effectively described the system requirements, design limitations, and suggested architecture in the documentation I created. I offered suggestions for scalable solutions like Docker for service separation, Kubernetes for container orchestration, and suitable cloud services for deployment and data storage. This method made sure that the design took into account the client's crucial needs for scalability, security, and cross-platform accessibility.

Examining the design document yielded insightful information that was really helpful when it came time to code. I was able to foresee any difficulties and match the execution with the client's expectations by using a methodical approach. By ensuring that every feature—from real-time sketching to authentication—was taken into consideration in the design, the method helped to define the system's components.

I would, however, make one revision to the documentation: the evaluation section. Although it successfully contrasted platforms such as Mac, Linux, Windows, and mobile devices, it may be improved by adding more information or metrics to support the suggestions. The review would be more thorough and convincing with more in-depth performance insights and comparison analysis.

Scalability, security, and user accessibility were my top priorities while interpreting the client's demands. Along with strong user authentication and data management systems, the design included features like real-time sketching and scoring. By attending to these requirements, the finished product was guaranteed to meet customer expectations, reduce mistakes, and offer a flawless experience. Any software design process must take user demands into account as they affect the program's usability and efficacy. Ignoring these requirements may result in reduced user involvement, expensive modifications, and discontent.

In order to guarantee modularity and code reuse, my method of software design mostly depended on object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance and encapsulation. The architecture was created with scalability in mind, utilizing contemporary frameworks and technologies to efficiently handle increasing user traffic. I would use user journey mapping to visualize and optimize user interactions, apply Agile approaches for iterative feedback, and employ prototyping tools to improve the UI/UX early in the design process in future projects. By guaranteeing alignment with user requirements and customer objectives, these tactics would improve the design process as well as the finished product.
